# CLI overview

The CLI organizes actions into subcommands. The exact list may evolve; see:
```bash
speacoupy --help
```
and
```bash
speacoupy simulate --help
```

Common patterns:
- `speacoupy simulate <config.yaml>`: run a simulation using a YAML configuration.
- `--output <folder>`: choose an output directory (plots, CSV).
- `--format <png|svg|csv>`: choose output formats if available.
- `--plots`: request generation of standard plots (SPL, impedance, phase).

> The **Commands** page is autogenerated during CI from `--help` so it always matches your installed version.
