# SpeAcouPy Documentation

Welcome! This site is for **users who want to simulate loudspeaker systems** with the **SpeAcouPy CLI**.  
You don't need Python knowledge to *use* the tool; copy the YAML examples and run the CLI.

- Start with **[Getting started](getting-started.md)**.
- Learn the ideas behind the tool in **[Concepts](concepts/overview.md)**.
- Explore a hands-on tutorial: **[Sealed box](tutorials/sealed-box.md)**.
- Prefer offline reading? **[Download the full PDF](pdf/SpeAcouPy.pdf)**.

If you're a power user interested in Python internals, see the (future) **Advanced** appendix.
