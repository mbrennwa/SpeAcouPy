# Interpreting results

Typical outputs (depends on CLI options):
- **SPL vs frequency** (on-axis): dB referenced to 20 µPa at 1 m.
- **Electrical impedance**: real and imaginary parts or magnitude/phase.
- **Cone excursion**: useful to assess limits at low frequencies (if available).
- **Port velocity** (vented): to check chuffing risk (if available).

**Rules of thumb (sealed):**
- Box **volume ↓** → **Fc ↑**, **Qtc ↑** → more peaking and earlier roll-off.
- Driver with **lower Qts** in a small box → tighter low-end, less extension.
