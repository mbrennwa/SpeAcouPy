# simulation of a Faital 12PR320 woofer in a closed box. Woofer TSP as in validation/driver/...

elements:

- type: sealed_box
  label: CLOSEDBOX
  Vb: 0.025     # m³  (50 liters internal volume)
  ### Rb: Inf      # mechanical resistance reflecting losses due to to leaks and stuffing with damping materials (Pa·s/m³). Note: Rb = Qb x rho x c² / 2pi / fb Vb
  Rb: 4.75E5    # Vituix: fb = 93.8 Hz, Ql = 100, Qa = 100 ==> Qb = 1/(1/Ql+1/Qa = 50 ==> Rb = 4.75E5
